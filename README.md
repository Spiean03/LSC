# LSC1

A programmable multi purpose control unit for vacuum systems, such as roughing pumps, turbo pumps, gate valves, vent valves, temperature kits and pressure gauges. Analogue and digital input channels allow for monitoring temperatures and vacuum levels or readout of safety switches. Several 24V power outputs for direct connection of solenoid valves are provided. Values are displayed on the illuminated LCD screen.

* Large LCD display
* Programmable Accoustic Alarm Function
* 6 programmable Control Buttons on Front Panel
* 3 Mosfet Channels
* 4 programmable Power Output Channels (24V 0.25A max)
* 6 Open Collector Output Channels (40V 30mA max)
* 2x4 Digital Inputs, isolated
* 3 programmable MOS-Contacts (40V 0.2A max)
* 7 Analog Input (0-10V) and 2 Analog Output (0-10V) Channels
* PT100 Temperature Input Channel

Increased application space for the analysis of materials where specimens must be transported under cryo- and/or ultra-high vacuum conditions, e.g. biological- and hydrogen-containing materials or surfaces prone to rapid oxidation. This includes:

* Transfer of specimens under ultra-high vacuum and cryogenic conditions between different vacuum-controlled systems
* Direct docking to the standard L-port present on a majority of Thermo Fisher DualBeamâ„¢ Systems
* Vibration free operation, does not compromise the FIB imaging resolution
* Specimen loading sequence can be applied without software modification using an additional control logic interface

An inert gas glove box can be a central hub for establishing a controlled sample environment transfer between independent analytical instruments. This docking station can be mounted to the side wall of the glovebox. A parking sledge for the UHVCTM on a mechanical support is provided. The docking station includes a programmable controller for vave control and the readout of vacuum gauges.

* V1 - Reduced Version: Venting and Pumping of the Cryo Dock and Load Lock simplified to one task
